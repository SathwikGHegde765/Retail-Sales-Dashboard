# Retail Sales Dashboard

## Project Overview

This repository contains a Power BI dashboard designed to analyze retail sales performance. The dashboard provides key insights into sales trends, profitability, customer behavior, and product performance across various dimensions.

## Key Features of the Dashboard

* **Overall Sales Performance:** Sum of Amount, Quantity, Profit, and Average Order Value (AOV).
* **Sales by State:** Visualization of sales distribution across different states (e.g., Maharashtra, Karnataka, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh).
* **Sales by Payment Mode:** Breakdown of sales by payment methods (e.g., UPI, EMI, COD, Credit Card).
* **Profit by Month:** Monthly profit trends, highlighting peak and low periods.
* **Sales by Customer:** Top customers based on sales amount.
* **Sales by Category:** Distribution of sales across product categories (e.g., Phones, Furniture, Electronic, Clothing).
* **Profit by Sub-Category:** Profitability of different product sub-categories (e.g., Phones, Chairs, Printers, Laptops, Trousers, Saree).

## Data Source

* The dashboard is built using a sample retail sales dataset.
* **(Optional: If you include data files)** The raw data is available in the `data/` folder (e.g., `retail_data.csv`).
* **(Optional: If data is external)** Data was sourced from [mention source, e.g., a SQL database, Excel file located at X drive, Kaggle dataset link].

## How to Use/View the Dashboard

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/YourUsername/Retail-Sales-Dashboard.git](https://github.com/YourUsername/Retail-Sales-Dashboard.git)
    ```
    (Replace `YourUsername` with your actual GitHub username.)
2.  **Open with Power BI Desktop:**
    * Navigate to the cloned folder.
    * Open the `Retail_Sales_Dashboard.pbix` file using Power BI Desktop.
3.  **Refresh Data (if applicable):** If the data source is not embedded or requires a refresh, ensure you have access to the specified data source and refresh the data within Power BI Desktop.

## Technologies Used

* **Power BI Desktop:** For data modeling, visualization, and dashboard creation.
* **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions):** For calculated measures and columns.
* **(Optional: If you used it)** SQL / Python / R: For data extraction and transformation (e.g., if you used scripts in Power Query).

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

* Implement row-level security for multi-user access.
* Add more detailed time intelligence functions (e.g., Year-over-Year growth).
* Integrate with a live database for real-time reporting.
* Expand analysis to include marketing spend and ROI.
